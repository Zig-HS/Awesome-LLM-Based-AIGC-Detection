# Awesome LLM-Based AIGC Detection

A curated list of research papers on **detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) using Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
This repository aims to track the latest advances in identifying text, code, multimodal, or other content generated by LLMs and generative AI systems.

## Paper List

| Title | Venue | Year | Modality | Task | Code | Insights |
|-------|-------|------|----------|------|------|----------|
| [Title of the Paper](https://paper-link.example.com) | e.g., ACL, NeurIPS, arXiv | 2024 | Text / Code / Multimodal / Speech / Image+Text | e.g., Detection, Attribution, Robustness Evaluation | [GitHub](https://github.com/...) / 🔒 / ❌ | Brief technical insight or key finding (e.g., "Uses watermarking + perplexity"; "Fails under paraphrasing attacks") |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

> **Column Descriptions**:
> - **Title**: Clickable link to the paper (preferably official or arXiv).
> - **Venue**: Conference/journal or `arXiv` if preprint.
> - **Year**: Publication year.
> - **Modality**: Input type the detector handles (e.g., `Text`, `Code`, `Multimodal`).
> - **Task**: Specific detection task (e.g., `LLM-generated text detection`, `Cross-model attribution`).
> - **Code**: Link to official implementation, or mark as `🔒` (private), `❌` (not available).
